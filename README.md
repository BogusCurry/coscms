Coscms is a small and simple CMS system / framework for building websites. Easy to use, administer, and extend with modules (both web and shell modules, and templates). Aims is modularity, easy install on Linux (can be done with two scripts), setup. Export websites as simple profiles. Easy to install and use with Debian systems (like Ubuntu 10.04  or Debian 6.0.0 - tested versions). You will need PHP >= 5.3 and a MySQL database. So far: Only tested on Apache2 and Debian systems.
