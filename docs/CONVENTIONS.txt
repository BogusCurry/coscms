Conventions for naming path, modules and classes:

modules should have a saying name, like
- module_system

tables connected to module_system should be called something like
- module_system_file
- module_system_release

Base classes connected to a module, e.g. module_system should have the name:
- moduleSystem

Extended classes should have names like moduleSystemRelease
for a sub module connected to module_system

e.g. base module_system is located like this

modules/module_system

a sub module like moduleRelease
modules/module_system/release: should have the following base class name:

moduleSystemRelease
