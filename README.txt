CosCms is a small transparent CMS. 

- PDO driven (only supports MySQL)
- Simple migration of all modules - up and down with .sql files.  
- Profiles: Create a system with some modules and a template and distribute it. 
- Translate the system to your language (only support one language per site)
- html templating (based on html and css)
- templating of modules without template engines. (I call that a feature!)
- locale inclusion and css and javascript in your modules
- UTF-8 charset only. 
- Easy shell install of the system. One command installs all. 
- Write Shell modules with ease. 

Current supported profiles: 

- Blog: A small website demonstrating the system as a blog system
- CMS: A small CMS 

Where many other systems does a lot about making the system works on any 
platform CosCms does not do that. It is mainly tested on Linux systems. 
I am a happy user of Ubuntu, which I have used the last couple of years,
so all programming and testing is done on Ubuntu. 

Is easy to install (on linux - testing is done on Ubuntu). Windows install is
not supported at the moment, but with some (maybe hard) effort it is possible .)

For install instuctions see docs/INSTALL.txt

On debian systems there is a install script which you can find on the following url:
